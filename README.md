# Brandon Shelly  
Hardware & PCB Design Engineer  

I design, build, and debug real hardware with a focus on **power electronics, PCB layout, and bring-up**.  
My work emphasizes **electrical correctness, EMI-aware routing, and debug-first design**.

I have over 8 years of hands-on experience in electronics, including work on aerospace and defense-adjacent projects, and I specialize in boards that power up cleanly and can be validated efficiently.

## 🔧 Core Skills
- PCB design (KiCad)
- Power electronics (buck converters, LDOs)
- EMI-aware layout and grounding
- Hardware bring-up & validation
- Test-point-driven debugging
- SMD soldering and rework

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
- Layout decisions are driven by current flow, not aesthetics
- Power integrity matters more than trace symmetry
- Every board should be debuggable without guesswork
- Conservative ratings build trust
